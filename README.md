# Gradient Flow Visualizer

This package provides an interactive Streamlit app to visualize the gradient flow of a simple neural network during training. You can adjust the network's parameters and see real-time updates of the loss and gradient magnitudes.

## Features

- **Neural Network Settings**: Configure the number of layers, hidden size, activation function, and learning rate.
- **Live Gradient Flow**: Visualize the gradient norms across different layers during training.
- **Real-time Feedback**: See the loss curve and how gradients change over time as you adjust parameters.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-visualizer.git
cd gradient-visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
