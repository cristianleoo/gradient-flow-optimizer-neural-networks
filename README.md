# Gradient Flow Visualizer

This package provides an interactive Streamlit app to visualize the gradient flow of a simple neural network during training. You can adjust the network's parameters and see real-time updates of the loss and gradient magnitudes.

## Features

- **Neural Network Settings**: Configure the number of layers, hidden size, activation function, and learning rate.
- **Live Gradient Flow**: Visualize the gradient norms across different layers during training.
- **Real-time Feedback**: See the loss curve and how gradients change over time as you adjust parameters.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-visualizer.git
cd gradient-visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üß† How It Works

The Gradient Flow Visualizer leverages Streamlit for its interactive interface and PyTorch for neural network training. The main components include:

1. **Neural Network Models**: Implemented in `src/model/model.py` and `src/model/sparse_model.py`.
2. **Training Loop**: Defined in `src/training/training.py`.
3. **Data Loading**: Handled by `src/data/dataloader.py`.
4. **Visualization**: Powered by `src/visualizer/visualizer.py`.

The application allows users to configure network parameters, select datasets, and visualize gradient flow in real-time during training.

## üìä Interpreting Results

The Gradient Flow Visualizer provides several key visualizations:

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: Visual representation of the network structure.
2. **Metrics History**: Plots of various performance metrics over training epochs.
3. **Gradient Flow Distribution**: Box plots showing the distribution of gradient norms across layers.
4. **Gradient Flow Over Time**: Line plots depicting how gradient norms change during training.
5. **Gradient Flow Statistics**: Detailed statistics on gradient behavior for each layer.

These visualizations help identify issues like vanishing or exploding gradients and assess the overall health of gradient flow in the network.
